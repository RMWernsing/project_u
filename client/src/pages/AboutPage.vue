              Project U is a fitness tracking and calorie counting app that utilizes a database of different foods and
              recipes with nutritional information that you can log for the day, with an account page that visualizes
              how many calories you've eaten for the day and how close or how far over you are for your daily goal as
              well as your previous days logs. Project U also allows you to save recipes and food items to your account
              so that you can quickly add commonly eaten items to your calorie count from the account page.

              The three of us are students at Boise Codeworks and this project is the first project that we've all
              worked on that was conceptualized and built from scratch

              We all had a lot of fun working on it and learned how difficult, but rewarding building a full stack
              application from scratch can be.

              We implemented multiple technologies, such as the Spoonacular API, Mongo DB, the Vue front end
              framework, Postman, and node.js to build our own backend. We experimented with many to many relationships
              in our database and implemented different methods that allowed us to create a day on load of the
              application.
